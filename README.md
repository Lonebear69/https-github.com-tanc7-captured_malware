# Captured malware variant

Detected something suspicious when I entered the command netstat -antp. It appears to be connecting back to a Amazon AWS server on listener port 10000

# Forensic analysis

Removed /usr/bin/atd and submitted to VirusTotal, which pointed out that it is a new variant of Patooty.A

Changed file permissions to 400 using chmod and then used binwalk entropy analysis. The graph shows that the file is about 3x larger than it's usual size and makes heavy use of encoding and obfuscation techniques to hide it's intents.

Noticed that there is something really strange about the code when using objdump -D, it seems to be re-encoded multiple times using XOR exclusive-or. Approximately 30445 lines of it has a XOR Assembly Opcode.

The app appears to have no other purpose than to connect back to the AWS address. p0f flagged the traffic as suspicious.

When observing the strings using IDA decompiler/disassembler, it made several references to a popular alternative Remote Access Trojan called Pupy. As well as debugging strings referring to alternative injection methods if it was a Windows target. Which in this case would be reflective DLL injection.

# Additional notes

Compiled with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, using gcc version 4.7
